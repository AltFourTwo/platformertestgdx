Culmination of what I've done so far with LibGDX

LibGDX is a Java library for developping multi-platform games,  
it encapsulates the basics of OpenGL and allows for relatively efficient resource manipulation.  
(Music, Sounds, Textures, Map Data)

I've learned and used many things to create this
- Collision detection and handling
- Dynamically read, create and display objects read from map data files
- Create custom Widgets for the UI
- Create widget styles
- 9-Patch image format
- Tiled, a 2d tiled map maker program
